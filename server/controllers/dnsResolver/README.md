## Other GeoLocation API's

<!-- 
  GeoIP-Lite is in components and was tested:
    The issue with these is that updates on the GeoLocation Files
    requires manual update. For premium information you will need
    an API key.
    GeoIP-Lite allows free minimal info without API Key
    IP2Location allows the LITE db file to be downloaded (update monthly)
      or, you can get an API Key
    Node-IPinfo def requires API Key
